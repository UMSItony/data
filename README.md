### Description of our Data
This repository contains one dataset, COVID-19 Jail/Prison Confirmed Cases & Deaths, in `.csv` and `.xlsx` formats. We've also posted a data dictionary to accompany the data, `data_dictionary_confirmed_cases_deaths.pdf`. It contains FAQs, a description of each variable, and notes about how each state reports Covid-19 counts. The data were collected by Grace diLaura and Kalind Parish.

The data contain cumulative confirmed COVID-19 case counts and death counts in U.S. jail/prison facilities, separately for staff and residents, for every day since data collection began on March 31st, 2020. The data were collected primarily from Department of Corrections websites. Not all states report facility-specific counts, so some rows of the dataset are aggregate state-wide counts, not counts within a specific facility. You can identify these rows by filtering on column `Facility.Specific == 0`. For more information about the format of the data and our data collection procedure, please see our data dictionary data_dictionary_confirmed_cases_deaths.pdf`.
