### Description of the Data
This repository contains one dataset, COVID-19 Jail/Prison Confirmed Cases & Deaths, in `.csv` and `.xlsx` formats. We've also posted a codebook to accompany the data, `codebook_confirmed_cases_deaths.pdf`.

The data contain cumulative confirmed COVID-19 case counts and death counts in U.S. jail/prison facilities, separately for staff and residents, for every day since we began data collection on March 31st, 2020. The data were collected primarily from Department of Corrections websites. Not all states report facility-specific counts, so some rows of the dataset are aggregate state-wide counts, not counts within a specific facility. You can identify these rows by filtering on column `facility_specific == 0`. For more information about the format of the data and our data collection procedure, we respectfully refer you to our codebook, `codebook_confirmed_cases_deaths.pdf`.

Thank you to Grace diLaura and Kalind Parish who collected the data with the help of many volunteers. Thank you to Topos AI to geocoding our data to ascertain the location of each jail/prison facility.
